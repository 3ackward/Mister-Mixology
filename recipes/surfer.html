      <p>
        Growing up in New Jersey, I used to love spending whole days down on the rocky beaches of New England, watching the 
        trash barges float out on the ice cold water, just thinking about what it would be like to live somewhere I could surf. 
        My friends and I would often skip class, throw on our coats, hats, gloves, extra socks and underwear, extra coats, boots, 
        and trudge through the fume-blackened snow to <i>Co-co-mo</i>, our local surf-themed coffee shop. It was owned by a man 
        named Fucky, an old Dead Head from San Francisco.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fucky would tell us all kinds of cool stories about surfing, Woodstock, the counterculture, hanging out with the Beat Poets 
        and how Kerouac stole his idea for <i>On the Road</i>, some of Charles Manson’s more misunderstood ideas, and of course his 
        extensive PTSD from Vietnam. <i>Those were the good ol’ days</i>, he’d say as he served us lukewarm coffee, before drifting 
        off into one of his classic thousand-yard stares. My friends and I decided to make some good ol’ days of our own; if we 
        couldn’t make it out to the Pacific surf, we’d bring some of it home to us.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, after stealing some tropical-sounding liquor from my dad’s dry bar and buying high-strength hallucinogens from Fucky, 
        we set out to make a drink called Surfer on Acid. Of course, there was no internet back then, so we had to get creative. 
        After several hours of turning my parent’s garage into a cocktail laboratory, we arrived at the following recipe. And that’s 
        where my love for mixology, as well as my persistent acid flashbacks, began. 
      </p> 
      <div class="ingredients-container">
        <ul>
            <li>Bacardi 151 rum</li>
            <li>Malibou coconut rum</li>
            <li>4 lemons, halved</li>
            <li>Mountain Dew, Baja Blast</li>
            <li>1 half-bucket of sea water</li>
            <li>3 sheets CIA-grade LSD</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="steps-container">
        <ol>
            <li>
            Take one to three tabs of LSD and ingest orally. Add a fourth if you’re feeling spicy!
            </li>
            <li>
            Once the drugs start to take hold, drag your half-filled bucket of ocean water to the middle of your garage. 
            Don’t worry if there’s some detritus floating on top, as the alcohol will kill any harmful bacteria or sea bugs 
            swimming around in there. Also, you may want to lay a tarp down to catch any tasty overflow!
            </li>
            <li>
            Toss your lemons like grenades into the bucket, followed by both bottles of rum. As you pour, the stream of liquor 
            should look like a colorful electric waterful. Don’t worry, it’s not actually charged with lightning, it’s all in 
            your mind! Mind! Mind! MInd! MINd! MIND! MINED! MYND! MY-
            </li>
            <li>
            Ingest one more tab of acid and throw the rest into the bucket to dissolve, much like our consciousness dissolves 
            back into the ether when we die. Think about it!
            </li>
            <li>
            At this time, it’s important to prop the garage door open about an inch to let some of the fumes escape, as well as to keep 
            an eye out for any wild faeries or government agents that may be poking around in the driveway. Lie on the ground for 
            several hours to get a better view of the neighborhood!
            </li>
            <li>
            Once some of the more overwhelming visuals fade, you should be surprised to find the bucket is still sitting in the middle 
            of the room. Tada! The mixture is now infused with chemical enlightenment and pretty dang close to sterile. 
            It’s also highly combustible, so don’t spark any wicked doobies just yet!
            </li>
            <li>
            Using a ladle, fill a Solo cup halfway for each of your friends, yourself, and one extra. Top with Mountain Dew, 
            and there you have it! Take your Surfers on Acids on a walk to the nearby graveyard, pour the extra one out on the curb 
            (you know, for Dennis Wilson), and enjoy the rest of your snowy evening or whatever arbitrary time it may be at this point. 
            <i>Now</i> you can spark those doobies, bro. <i><b>Cheers!</b></i>
