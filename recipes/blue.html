        Alright gang, I’m really excited about this one. The mixology Gods are communicating through me, using my Earthly vessel 
        as a conduit for divine, alcoholic inspiration. I don’t think any revelations have ever rocked the world of drink making 
        to its very core like this one has. Here’s the story:
      </p>
      <p>
        I was wandering the spirits aisle of my local grocery store, when I came upon a discovery. Blue Curacao. It’s beautiful, 
        unlike anything I’ve ever seen. And it occurred to me: what if- just hear me out- a drink, an entire <i>cocktail</i> was, 
        get this… <i><b>blue.</b></i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Curacao in hand and vibrating with excitement and inspiration, I darted around the store like a rabid ferret, collecting 
        anything else blue I could find. Surely Curacao has been used in cocktail recipes before, but an <i>entirely blue</i> 
        cocktail? I think not. I filled my shopping basket with blue items, as well as a pineapple because that’s what I had come 
        there for, and hurried home to hit the laboratory. I worked all night, didn’t sleep at all (but I feel great!) and here’s 
        what I came up with. I hope you’re ready, world!
      </p>
        
      <div class="ingredients-container">
        <ul>
            <li>Blue Curacao</li>
            <li>1 cup blueberries</li>
            <li>20 oz Gatorade, Cool Blue</li>
            <li>1/4 lb blue cheese</li>
            <li>15 oz Listerine, Cool Mint</li>
            <li>6 oz Colgate MaxFresh</li>
            <li>12 oz NyQuil</li>
            <li>1 pineapple, sliced</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="steps-container">
        <ol>
          <li>
            Stop up the kitchen sink. Run the faucet for a second to make sure it’s watertight; wouldn’t want to lose any of this 
            magic down the drain!
          </li>
          <li>
            Dump the blueberries into the sink and muddle. If you’re like me and you don’t have a muddler, you can simply use your 
            fists like I did to punch the blue out of the berries. I believe that’s where the term “punch” comes from, in a 
            beverage context. It also adds a subtle violent edge to your recipe.  
          <li>
            Pour the Blue Curacao in and lap some of it up like a dog to absorb its essence. You really want to feel the blue 
            <i>coursing</i> through your body while you mix up the rest of this concoction. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the Gatorade. Look how fucking blue it is!
          </li>
          <li>
            Take the chunk of blue cheese and use a tiny spoon to scrape some of the mold into the batch. This will add a 
            nuanced saltiness and savoriness that will only sharpen with time.
          </li>
          <li>
            At this point, I started to run out of blue substances that are traditionally considered a “beverage” or “consumable.” 
            Brilliantly, however, I had wandered into the health and beauty section of the store and realized mouthwash and NyQuil 
            are sort of the nerdy cousins of alcohol anyway! So let’s add some of that shit to the mix for both flavor <b>and</b> 
            chemical value and fuck it let’s throw in some children’s toothpaste for viscosity! Look at the <i>legs</i> in that sink!
          </li>
          <li>
            After whisking it up, you’re ready to serve! Scoop some out with a wine glass or Yahtzee shaker and garnish with a 
            slice of pineapple. Or, fuck it, hack the pineapple to bits, toss it in the sink, and drink directly from your 
            cerulean trough with a straw. Who’s going to stop you? <b> You are a GOD now. You are ONE with the Holy Spirits, 
            a walking party that bows before no man, law, or court-mandated urine test, that enters dive bars and holiday 
            family gatherings alike, leaving only velvety indigo stains and unheeded pleas of concern in its wake! 
            YOU. ARE. POSEIDON!!</b>
            <p>Plus, the blue color of the drink is super cute! <i><b>Cheers!</b></i></p>
